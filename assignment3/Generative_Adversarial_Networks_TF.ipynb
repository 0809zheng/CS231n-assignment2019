    "# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\n",
    "So far in CS231N, all the applications of neural networks that we have explored have been **discriminative models** that take an input and are trained to produce a labeled output. This has ranged from straightforward classification of image categories to sentence generation (which was still phrased as a classification problem, our labels were in vocabulary space and we\u2019d learned a recurrence to capture multi-word labels). In this notebook, we will expand our repetoire, and build **generative models** using neural networks. Specifically, we will learn how to build models which generate novel images that resemble a set of training images."

    "### What is a GAN?\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2014, [Goodfellow et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) presented a method for training generative models called Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs for short). In a GAN, we build two different neural networks. Our first network is a traditional classification network, called the **discriminator**. We will train the discriminator to take images, and classify them as being real (belonging to the training set) or fake (not present in the training set). Our other network, called the **generator**, will take random noise as input and transform it using a neural network to produce images. The goal of the generator is to fool the discriminator into thinking the images it produced are real.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of this back and forth process of the generator ($G$) trying to fool the discriminator ($D$), and the discriminator trying to correctly classify real vs. fake as a minimax game:\n",
    "$$\\underset{G}{\\text{minimize}}\\; \\underset{D}{\\text{maximize}}\\; \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p_\\text{data}}\\left[\\log D(x)\\right] + \\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim p(z)}\\left[\\log \\left(1-D(G(z))\\right)\\right]$$\n",
    "where $x \\sim p_\\text{data}$ are samples from the input data, $z \\sim p(z)$ are the random noise samples, $G(z)$ are the generated images using the neural network generator $G$, and $D$ is the output of the discriminator, specifying the probability of an input being real. In [Goodfellow et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661), they analyze this minimax game and show how it relates to minimizing the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the training data distribution and the generated samples from $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize this minimax game, we will aternate between taking gradient *descent* steps on the objective for $G$, and gradient *ascent* steps on the objective for $D$:\n",
    "1. update the **generator** ($G$) to minimize the probability of the __discriminator making the correct choice__. \n",
    "2. update the **discriminator** ($D$) to maximize the probability of the __discriminator making the correct choice__.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these updates are useful for analysis, they do not perform well in practice. Instead, we will use a different objective when we update the generator: maximize the probability of the **discriminator making the incorrect choice**. This small change helps to allevaiate problems with the generator gradient vanishing when the discriminator is confident. This is the standard update used in most GAN papers, and was used in the original paper from [Goodfellow et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will alternate the following updates:\n",
    "1. Update the generator ($G$) to maximize the probability of the discriminator making the incorrect choice on generated data:\n",
    "$$\\underset{G}{\\text{maximize}}\\;  \\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim p(z)}\\left[\\log D(G(z))\\right]$$\n",
    "2. Update the discriminator ($D$), to maximize the probability of the discriminator making the correct choice on real and generated data:\n",
    "$$\\underset{D}{\\text{maximize}}\\; \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p_\\text{data}}\\left[\\log D(x)\\right] + \\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim p(z)}\\left[\\log \\left(1-D(G(z))\\right)\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### What else is there?\n",
    "Since 2014, GANs have exploded into a huge research area, with massive [workshops](https://sites.google.com/site/nips2016adversarial/), and [hundreds of new papers](https://github.com/hindupuravinash/the-gan-zoo). Compared to other approaches for generative models, they often produce the highest quality samples but are some of the most difficult and finicky models to train (see [this github repo](https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks) that contains a set of 17 hacks that are useful for getting models working). Improving the stabiilty and robustness of GAN training is an open research question, with new papers coming out every day! For a more recent tutorial on GANs, see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00160). There is also some even more recent exciting work that changes the objective function to Wasserstein distance and yields much more stable results across model architectures: [WGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875), [WGAN-GP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00028).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "GANs are not the only way to train a generative model! For other approaches to generative modeling check out the [deep generative model chapter](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/generative_models.html) of the Deep Learning [book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org). Another popular way of training neural networks as generative models is Variational Autoencoders (co-discovered [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4082)). Variational autoencoders combine neural networks with variational inference to train deep generative models. These models tend to be far more stable and easier to train but currently don't produce samples that are as pretty as GANs.\n",

    "# Optimizing our loss\n",
    "Make an `Adam` optimizer with a 1e-3 learning rate, beta1=0.5 to mininize G_loss and D_loss separately. The trick of decreasing beta was shown to be effective in helping GANs converge in the [Improved Techniques for Training GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498) paper. In fact, with our current hyperparameters, if you set beta1 to the Tensorflow default of 0.9, there's a good chance your discriminator loss will go to zero and the generator will fail to learn entirely. In fact, this is a common failure mode in GANs; if your D(x) learns too fast (e.g. loss goes near zero), your G(z) is never able to learn. Often D(x) is trained with SGD with Momentum or RMSProp instead of Adam, but here we'll use Adam for both D(x) and G(z). "
